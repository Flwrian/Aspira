# Chess Game + Engine
This is a chess game and engine written in Java. Note that this is a work in progress and is not finished yet. There are a lot of things that need to be done. If you want to help, feel free to do so. I'm still learning new things and trying to play better chess too :)

## More info
I am aware that there are more efficient ways to program a chess engine. I am not trying to make the most efficient chess engine, but rather a chess engine that I made myself. I am also aware that there are a lot of bugs and glitches and that the code is not very clean.
## Done
- [x] Add a chess engine
- [x] Multiple algorithms for the engine
- [x] You can implement your own algorithm
- [x] Save and load games (FEN and PGN formats)
- [x] Fix weird pawn glitch (A file to H file)
- [x] UCI protocol
## Need to do
- [ ] Add a GUI
- [ ] Add castling
- [ ] Add en passant
- [ ] Add pawn promotion to other pieces than queen
- [ ] Add a timer
- [ ] Add a lot of tests


## Improvements
- [ ] Make the engine faster by using bitboards and other optimizations (see [here](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards))
- [ ] Use Zobrist hashing to speed up the engine
